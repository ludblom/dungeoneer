# Dungeoneer

This is my personal project and work on it when I have time to do so.

The goal is to have a TUI to play DnD on, with most of the basic racial, class and other features implemented.

As of now it is not finished, will notify when a working beta is in order.

## Contributing

If you feel like something is wrong or if you know of a better way to do something, please contact me directly. I feel the project is in too early stages for PR's, but I am open for critique and feedback! Once maybe one or two classes and races are in order and we have a solid ground I will open up for it. :)
